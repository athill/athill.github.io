Upgraded to Fedora 18 last night using <a href="http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/FedUp" target="_blank">FedUp</a>. Pretty smooth so far and I like the UI enhancements. However, Apache (web server) wouldn&#8217;t start. I slogged through several blog posts with limited success until someone mentioned <a href="http://linux.die.net/man/8/rpmconf" target="_blank">rpmconf</a>.

Basically, when Fedora upgrades your system, it keeps your current configuration files (e.g., Apache&#8217;s httpd.conf), but adds a default newer version, which in this case would be called httpd.conf.rpmnew.

rmpconf finds all these *.rpmnew files and gives you options to replace, keep, diff, pause, etc. all the configuration files for upgraded systems. Cool idea.
