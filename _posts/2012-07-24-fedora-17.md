So I copied my entire home directory (zipped) to my laptop and then jumped from Fedora 14 to 17 on my desktop, resulting in a semi-clean break and an opportunity to separate value from cruft and to organize the valued. I also used <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/febe/" target="_blank">FEBE</a> to backup my entire Firefox setup.

Anyway, so then I installed <a href="http://fedoraproject.org/get-fedora" target="_blank">Fedora 17</a>. The zip of my home directory from fed14 was 20GB, so it took a while for that to get over. Also ran into a glitch where you need to disable and reenable your firewall for ssh to work. Regardless, 20GB took a while, so in the mean time, I <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudo" target="_blank">set up sudo</a> and installed the<a href="https://live.gnome.org/GnomeTweakTool/" target="_blank"> Gnome Tweak Tool</a> and <a href="http://fedorautils.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">fedorautils</a>.

I made my old home directory a child of my new home directory. Since then, I&#8217;ve been going through the old files and moving things up to the new home directory as I get them pruned and organized. Fun stuff.

So what you see in the image above is my investigation and delegation/deletion of files. What&#8217;s kind of cool is that as I moved/removed files from the command line (in front), I was able to see the visual view (in back) change. OK, kind of lame, but still kind of amazing.
