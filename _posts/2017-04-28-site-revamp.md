Trying to clean things up a bit. This site uses the [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) [CSS preprocessor](https://www.sitepoint.com/6-current-options-css-preprocessors/). [CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets) defines the look of a web site. For example, before I made some changes, each post on this blog was rather generic looking. I modified the CSS so that it kind of looks like a computer terminal, with a header, green on black, and modified the [font](https://fonts.google.com/?category=Monospace&selection.family=VT323).
