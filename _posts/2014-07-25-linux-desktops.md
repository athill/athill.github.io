Stay with me. <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/home" target="_blank">Windows</a> and <a href="https://www.apple.com/mac/" target="_blank">Mac</a> are both &#8220;operating systems&#8221;. When you click on a file and it opens in your editor, the operating system does that. In Windows and Mac, the operating system is generally coupled with what&#8217;s called the &#8220;desktop environment&#8221;. For example, imagine your Windows computer could look and feel like a Mac or vice-versa.

In Linux, there are two primary players in the desktop environment game: <a href="http://www.gnome.org/" target="_blank">Gnome</a> and <a href="http://www.xfce.org/" target="_blank">KDE</a>. To generalize, I&#8217;d say Gnome is more like Mac and KDE is more like Windows. There are other desktop environments. For example, if you are pressed for hardware or prefer a leaner experience, [xfce][1] is often recommended.

Anyway, I&#8217;d been mostly using Gnome since 2003, but certain things about Gnome 3 leave one wanting, so I tried I tried KDE 4 for a while. I&#8217;m currently using <a href="http://cinnamon.linuxmint.com/" target="_blank">Cinnamon</a>, which seems promising.
