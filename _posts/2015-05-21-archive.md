Via the the impressive [wordpress-to-jekyll-exporter](https://github.com/benbalter/wordpress-to-jekyll-exporter), I've managed to convert my [codeblog](https://andyhill.us/codeblog/) [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) blog to [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/). 

Jekyll is not the new WordPress. It's apples and oranges. 

In WordPress, you go to your administration page and select to add a new post and are greeted with a nice interface to compose and configure your new post. 

In Jekyll, you add a text file to the _posts directory. The name of the text file must be in the following format: yyyy-mm-dd-slug, where

* yyyy is the four digit year
* mm is the one to two digit month
* dd is the one to two digit day
* slug is the title you see in your browser's address bar. For example, my-new-blog-post

The content of the properly named and placed text file then has the following format: 

* A [YAML](http://yaml.org/) configuration header (title, etc.)
* A [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) body

There's actually a lot more as far as global configuration, etc., but I actually *like* the idea (for simpler blogs) of just adding a text file (once you get the gist of YAML, Jekyll configuration, and Markdown) to create a new blog post.
