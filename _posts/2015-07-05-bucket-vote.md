title: Bucket Vote
---


Created a utility for bucket voting. A bucket vote is where a group is narrowing a list of options. For example, there could be 10 voters where 15 candidates are trying to fill 7 slots. In this case, each voter would be represented by a "bucket" and each candidate would be represented by an "item." Each voter could bring 7 items into their bucket and then the 7 items in the most buckets would fill the slots. 

It may be clearer to see it in action:
