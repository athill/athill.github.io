As I mentioned in the previous post, I'm excited about the idea of Progressive Web Apps. They allow client side caching of web content, intercepting of fetch requests, and other features that can provide an offline experience as well as a more performant online experience. Check out the <a href="https://athill.github.io/pwa-presentation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">presentation I did</a>.

I've converted two of my sites: <a href="https://andyhill.us" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://andyhill.us</a> and <a href="https://informedelectorate.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Informed Electorate</a> to be PWAs and they work great!
