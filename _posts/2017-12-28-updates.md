I took a couple short online classes last month: 
- <a href="https://www.udemy.com/devops-masterclass/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Get into DevOps: The Masterclass</a> from Udemy. A nice overview of DevOps technologies, including as Ansible, Chef, Puppet, Terraform, AWS, Google Apps, and GitLab.
- <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/offline-web-applications--ud899" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Offline Web Applications by Google</a> from Udacity. A pretty deep dive into Progressive Web Apps (PWAs), which I consider a game-changer as far as web site performance, offline experience, and promoting web apps to first-class applications.
