Trying out [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) with the [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) blogging platform. I think  the Jeckyll idea of serving static posts written in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), fits my blogging purposes better than the capable, but bloated for my purposes, [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/). 

To get started, I cloned Barry Clark's [Jekyll Now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) and am following other instructions from his [smashing article](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/01/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/).

Hoping to import the old posts from [andyhill.us/codeblog](http://andyhill.us/codeblog/) and, um, post more often.
